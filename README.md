# Fashion_Marketplace_Analysis_prj
## Fashion Marketplace Consumer Analysis

The project scope was a customer experience online analysis focused on the fashion market. 
We focused the attention on several items split in three main product categories (accessory, apparel, footwear), comparing rating, reviews on different web marketplaces (proprietary ecommerce, Amazon, JD).

Main activities:
1) Scraped products' data from the web platforms (i.e. rating, reviews, country, date, user...)
2) Processed raw data and executed data quality analysis
3) Created an ETL process via Snowflake (integration with R and Tableau) to obtain one overall dataset
4) Executed UX/UI analysis to understand and compare how a platform prefers to sell the product
5) Executed a sentiment analysis with R, comparing products' features (rating/reviews) among different platforms 
6) Performed data visualization through Tableau to show insights about average product ratings by country, by year and according to platform selected
